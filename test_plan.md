# Test Plan
1. List out in words each test that you intend to write:
I would test if the ordering process is coming through well, meaning, is the user able to navigate between the choices with their input?
I would also like to test for the total order and see if the dollar amount that comes through is accurate and adheres to how many items and what items the user ordered.
I would also like to test if the customer order on the page also accurately comes with the correct number of items. Or if the user adds an item, is the number of items added correct.

2. For each test that you intend to write, name the function or functions that you intend to call and test:
    1. Order Total
    2. Ordering Process
    3. Customer Order
